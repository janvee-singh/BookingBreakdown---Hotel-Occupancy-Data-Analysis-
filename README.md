This repository is a learning experience to apply concepts of Machine Learning to interpret the factors which are influencing the increased cancellation rates.

BUSINESS PROBLEM : In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address the problem.

SUGGESTIONS AFTER HOTEL DATA ANALYSIS : 

1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and retention (non cancellation) of the resort hotel is higher than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
